# ecobiblatex

A collaborative effort to provide biblatex files for most ecological journals.

[Biblatex](https://github.com/plk/biblatex) is a set of LaTeX macros to handle the printing of citations and references, designed to work with [biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/).
While it's really impressive and easy to use, there are not a lot of citation styles currently available, and this project aims to provide some for the most common ecological journals. 

## Styles currently implemented
